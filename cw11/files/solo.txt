Baby
It's kind of crazy
How else to phrase it?
With you I've lost my senses
Baby
What happened to ya?
I thought I knew ya
But now it's time to face it
You're hot and cold
High and you're low
Messin' with my mind
No, oh-oh, that's not how it goes
So, let me spell it out
Now I'm better solo, solo
I never let me down, didi-down-down-down
Now I'm gonna show ya, show ya
Show you what it is you're missing out
Now I'm better solo, solo
I never let me down, didi-down-down-down
Now I'm gonna show ya, show ya
How I be getting down, solo
Tell me
Now, was it worth it? (Oh)
Playin' me dirty (oh)
But now who's laughing, baby?
Watch me
All eyes on me now
Bet you regret how
What goes around comes around
You're hot and cold
High and you're low
Messin' with my mind
No, oh-oh, that's not how it goes
So, let me spell it out
Now I'm better solo, solo
I never let me down, didi-down-down-down
Now I'm gonna show ya, show ya
Show you what it is you're missing out
Now I'm better solo, solo
I never let me down, didi-down-down-down
Now I'm gonna show ya, show ya
How I be getting down, solo
No, no, I'm going solo
Yeah, ya better, better, watch me now
'Cause I know how to let go
Gonna make it, make it on my own, whoa
Oh, no, I'm going solo
Yeah, ya better, better, watch me now
'Cause I know how to let go
So, it's clear to see I'm
Now I'm better solo, solo
I never let me down, didi-down-down-down
Now I'm gonna show ya, show ya
Show you what it is you're missing out
Now I'm better solo, solo
I never let me down, didi-down-down-down
Now I'm gonna show ya, show ya
How I be getting down, solo
