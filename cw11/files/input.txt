Announcer
	And now back to Wheel of Fortune!
	The camera closes in on Randy, who's got his hands clenched, his thumbs up, and a big grin on his face. He pumps his fists softly. A new car waits behind him to win it
Pat Sajak
	All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round!
Randy
	Thanks, Pat!
Pat Sajak
	You've got some family here watching tonight. [a shot of Sharon, Shelly, and Stan in the audience. Sharon waves, then claps. Stan waves]
Randy
	Yeah, they're all rooting for me. [waving back to his family]
Pat Sajak
	And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home?
	The town bar. A crowd has gathered to watch the show. Kyle and Ike are there with their parents, Butters is there with his
Randy
	Yeah. [waving] Hi, everybody watching in South Park!
Jimbo
	That's us!
Stephen
	Hehey! [both thumbs up]
Man 1
	[amid other chatter, voice only] Hey Randy!
Jimbo
	Good luck!
	Back to the studio.
Pat Sajak
	Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is [the words appear onscreen as Vanna White gets ready to turn the letters on the board] People Who Annoy You.
Randy
	Okay. [deep exhale]
Pat Sajak
	As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E. [Some of the letters light up blue and Vanna taps on them: ERS] We just need three more consonants, and a vowel.
Randy
	Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
Pat Sajak
	And a vowel?
Randy
	[quickly crosses his fingers in both hands and grits his teeth] An O please.
Pat Sajak
	Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here. [more letters light up blue and Vanna taps on them. Randy claps softly] The category is People Who Annoy You. [the letters are NGG, but no O: N_GGERS. Randy stops clapping] Audience, keep quiet, please. [the white people in the audience are shocked and terrified while the black people are angry and glaring at Randy. One of the cameramen peeks out from behind the camera - he's black]
Randy
	Uh... Well, uh...
Pat Sajak
	Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh.
Randy
	I know it but I don't think I should say it.
Pat Sajak
	Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.
Randy
	Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle! [beat] N***ers! [the audience is stone quiet. Randy gets the buzzer for the wrong answer and drops his arms.] Huh? [Vanna goes to turn the last letter around - A - then walks back to her post and looks at the ground] Ohhh...
Stan
	[covers his eyes] Ooooh. [Sharon and Shelly are stunned]
Randy
	[subdued] Oh naggers. Of course, naggers. [sheepish grin] Right.
